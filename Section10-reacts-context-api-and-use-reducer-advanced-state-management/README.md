# Section 10: React's Context API & useReducer - Advanced State Management

Welcome to the "React's Context API & useReducer - Advanced State Management" section! This section delves into advanced state management techniques using React's Context API and the `useReducer` hook. Let's explore the modules:

## 162. Module Introduction

Get ready for an in-depth exploration of advanced state management techniques. The module introduction provides an overview of what to expect in this section and sets the stage for the upcoming modules.

## 163. Understanding Prop Drilling & Project Overview

Understand the challenges of prop drilling and gain insights into the project overview. Recognize the limitations of prop drilling and discover the need for advanced state management.

## 164. Prop Drilling: Component Composition as a Solution

Explore component composition as a solution to prop drilling challenges. Learn how to structure your components to avoid unnecessary data passing through multiple layers.

## 165. Introducing the Context API

Enter the world of the Context API. Discover how it simplifies state management by providing a way to share values like themes, user authentication, or any global state across components.

## 166. Creating & Providing The Context

Dive into creating and providing context within your React application. Understand the steps involved in setting up and sharing context values with components.

## 167. Consuming the Context

Learn how to consume context within your components. Explore techniques for accessing and utilizing context values in different parts of your application.

## 168. Linking the Context to State

Connect the context to the state of your application. Understand the relationship between context and state, and how they work together to manage your application's data.

## 169. A Different Way Of Consuming Context

Explore an alternative approach to consuming context. Learn different patterns and methods for integrating context into your components based on specific use cases.

## 170. What Happens When Context Values Change?

Understand the impact of changes in context values. Explore how your components react to updates in context, ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience.

## 171. Migrating the Entire Demo Project to use the Context API

Take your skills to the next level by migrating the entire demo project to utilize the Context API. Apply the concepts learned to real-world scenarios and enhance your project's architecture.

## 172. Outsourcing Context & State Into a Separate Provider Component

Optimize your application's structure by outsourcing context and state into a separate provider component. Learn best practices for managing context and state at a higher level.

## Coding Exercise 26: Creating & Using Context

Apply your knowledge by completing a coding exercise focused on creating and using context. Practice integrating context into your components and solidify your understanding.

## 173. Introducing the useReducer Hook

Enter the realm of the `useReducer` hook. Understand its purpose and how it provides an alternative approach to state management compared to the `useState` hook.

## 174. Dispatching Actions & Editing State with useReducer

Explore the process of dispatching actions and editing state using the `useReducer` hook. Understand how this hook streamlines complex state updates in your components.

## Coding Exercise 27: Using useReducer()

Apply the concepts learned in a coding exercise dedicated to using the `useReducer` hook. Practice implementing advanced state management techniques and reinforce your skills.
