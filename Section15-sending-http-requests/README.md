# Section 15: Sending Http Requests (e.g. Connecting to a Database)

Welcome to the "Sending Http Requests (e.g. Connecting to a Database)" section! In this section, we will explore the essentials of connecting a React application to a database using HTTP requests. Let's delve into the modules that cover the intricacies of sending HTTP requests and handling data:

## 226. Module Introduction

Get ready to dive into the world of HTTP requests! The module introduction sets the stage for understanding how to connect a React application to a database using HTTP.

## 227. How (Not) To Connect To A Database

Learn about common mistakes and how to avoid them when connecting to a database. Understand the do's and don'ts of database connectivity.

## 228. Starting Project & Dummy Backend API

Set up the initial project and create a dummy backend API. Lay the groundwork for practicing and implementing HTTP requests.

## 229. Preparing the App For Data Fetching

Prepare your React application for data fetching. Set the stage for sending and receiving data from the backend.

## 230. How NOT To Send HTTP Requests (And Why It's Wrong)

Understand common pitfalls when sending HTTP requests and why certain approaches are not recommended. Learn from mistakes to write efficient code.

## 231. Sending HTTP Requests (GET Request) via useEffect

Explore how to send HTTP GET requests using the useEffect hook. Understand the asynchronous nature of fetching data and how to handle it.

## 232. Using async / await

Dive into the usage of the async/await syntax for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code. Learn how it simplifies working with promises.

## 233. Handling Loading States

Implement loading states to enhance the user experience. Learn how to indicate when data is being fetched and keep users informed.

## 234. Handling HTTP Errors

Address and manage errors that may occur during HTTP requests. Implement error handling strategies for a robust application.

## 235. Transforming Fetched Data

Explore techniques for transforming data fetched from the backend. Ensure that the data is presented in the desired format within your application.

## 236. Extracting Code & Improving Code Structure

Optimize your code by extracting and organizing functions. Improve the overall code structure for better maintainability.

## 237. Sending Data with POST Requests

Learn how to send data to the backend using HTTP POST requests. Understand the process of creating and updating data on the server.

## 238. Using Optimistic Updating

Implement optimistic updating to provide a seamless user experience. Learn how to update the UI optimistically before receiving confirmation from the server.

## 239. Deleting Data (via DELETE HTTP Requests)

Explore the process of deleting data from the backend using HTTP DELETE requests. Understand how to handle the removal of data gracefully.

## 240. Practice: Fetching Data

Apply your knowledge in a practical exercise by fetching data from the backend. Reinforce your understanding of the concepts covered in this section.
